# Yabeda::DelayedJob

Built-in metrics for [DelayedJob](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) background workers monitoring out of the box! Part of the [yabeda](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda) suite.


## Metrics

Works as the DelayedJjob plugin and provides following metrics:
 - `jobs_enqueued_total` - the counter of enqueued jobs (segmented by queue/worker)
 - `jobs_failed_total`/`jobs_errored_total` - the counter of failed/errored jobs (segmented by queue/worker/error)
 - `jobs_waiting_count` - the number of jobs are waited for execution, queue size (segmented by queue).
 - `queue_latency` - the queue latency - difference in seconds since the oldest job was enqueued (segmented by queue)
 - `job_runtime` - the histogram of job running time (in seconds, segmented by queue, worker)
 - `running_job_runtime` - the running time of currently executed job (segmented by queue, worker). Helps to determine long running jobs.

## Details
